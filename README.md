## Updating Your README.md

**When you develop something that you want other people to
use, you need to have a README.**

# Program features
## cli.py
## car.py
[1] Builds out the cars table
    - the __repr__ function defines the structure of the output display
[2] Imports important dependencies for the cars table
    - It imports sqlalchemy from which the foreign key and other table structures are included
    
## owner.py
[1] Builds out the owners table
    - the __repr__ function defines the structure of the output display

[2] Imports important dependencies for the owners table
    - It imports sqlalchemy, base and session packages to aid in the migration of data to the database
## seed.py
[1] This file contains data that populates the database
## session.py
## base.py


### What Goes into a README?

This README should serve as a template for your own- go through the important
files in your project and describe what they do. Each file that you edit
(you can ignore your Alembic files) should get at least a paragraph. Each
function should get a small blurb.

You should descibe your actual CLI script first, and with a good level of
detail. The rest should be ordered by importance to the user. (Probably
functions next, then models.)

Screenshots and links to resources that you used throughout are also useful to
users and collaborators, but a little more syntactically complicated. Only add
these in if you're feeling comfortable with Markdown.

## Conclusion

A lot of work goes into a good CLI, but it all relies on concepts that you've
practiced quite a bit by now. Hopefully this template and guide will get you
off to a good start with your Phase 3 Project.

Happy coding!
